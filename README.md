This is my page where I am going to talk about my data engineering journey I am about to embark now.

Brief about me:- 
  
Who I am right now:- I have close to 5 years of work expereince in Operations and I have mostly been at the end of using and more-so-ever, producing the data. 
 Why am I doing this:- Fairly and simply because I want to understand the use case of the data I am producing. (DE's get paid a lot too!!)
  How?:- Oh to Fuck around and find out! <
