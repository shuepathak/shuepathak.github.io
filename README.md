This is my page where I am going to talk about my data engineering journey I am about to embark upon! 

Brief about me:- 
Who I am right now:- I have close to 5 years of work expereince in Operations and I have mostly been at the end of using and more-so-ever, producing the data. 
Why am I doing this:- Fairly and simply because I want to understand the use case of the data I am producing. (DE's get paid a lot too!!)
How?:- Oh to Fuck around and find out! 


I am sure of the fact that the page that I have just made (or created a repo) will look very un-organized but please bear with me, this is work in progress. 

This is my blogpost/ portfolio of the projects, I will write about what I faced issues with, how I managed to do x and what sources I took. 


I am hoping we kindle in this journey, you like my work and please if you have any suggestion by any means, reach out to me in the given below ways:-
