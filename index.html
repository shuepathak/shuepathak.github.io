    <h1>Welcome data lovers ❤️ ❤️ <h1>
    <h2>I will write the inauguration code here, print "Hello world"</h2>
   <hr> 
    <p>Thank you for visiting! This is my page where I am going to talk about my data engineering journey I am excited to share about my learning and the type of projects I will be doing. This is my portfolio page.
</p>
    
    <h2>Brief about me</h2>
    <p>My name is Shubham and I love Data and the various use cases attributed to just "data". As Gavin Belson says, there will be Armageddon soon, (Silicon Valley reference) I am motivated to learn how data can be stored, supplied and utilised in the best way possible!</p>
    
    <h3>Who I am right now:</h3>
    <p>I am 23, based out of Pune IN. I work at Barclays. I am also a BS in Data science and applications student at IIT Madras. I have close to 5 years of work experience in Operations as I started working right after college.</p>
    
    <h3>Why am I doing this:</h3>
    <p>Fairly and simply because I want to understand the use case of the data I am producing. My job revolves around producing data, I want to join the data's journey from being produced to being stored to being called useful. As geeky as it sounds, data excites me and I know with the coming dawn of AI and its amazing new course, a good data set can make or break the model. (DEs get paid a lot too!!)</p>
    
    <h3>How?</h3>

    <p> By working on a lot of projects! I will share URLs for all the topics I will pick up </p>
        
    <p>This is my blog post/ portfolio of the projects, I will write about what I faced issues with, how I managed to do x and what sources I took. This is my diary but for projects, I wish to show everyone :) I understand that the page that I have just made (or created a repo) will look very unorganised but please bear with me, this is a work in progress.

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <h4><a href="http://www.assistsdev.com">assist</a></h4>
        <p>assist is a platform designed to help contact centres automate their workflow. This project aims to streamline operations and improve efficiency in customer service environments.</p>
        <p><strong>The site may not respond, as I am building the web-app</strong></p>
	<h4><a href="https://github.com/shuepathak/weather-data-collector"> Weather Data Collector AWS Batch Streaming</a></h4>
	    <p>The Weather Data Collector is a serverless application built on AWS that automatically fetches, processes, and stores weather data. The application utilizes AWS Lambda for computation, retrieves data from a public weather API, stores raw data in Amazon S3, and saves processed data in an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL database The frequency is set to x minutes and can be customised.</p>
	<h4><a href="https://github.com/shuepathak/realtimeweather.git"> Real Time Weather Streaming on Local</a></h4>
	    <p>This project sets up a simple weather data streaming service using Flask and Server-Sent Events (SSE). It continuously streams real-time weather data fetched from a third-party API. This is real time and it can be amended</p>
	    <h4><a href="https://github.com/shuepathak/todo"> Task Management System </a></h4> 
	    <p> This Task Management System is a simple command-line application built in Python. I have written this to brush up my Python basics.</p>
