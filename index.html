    <h1>Welcome datalovers ❤️ ❤️</h1>
    <h2>I will just write the inauguration code here, print "hello world"</h2>
    
    <p>Thank you for visiting! 
	This is my page where I am going to talk about my data engineering journey I am excited to share about my learning and the type of projects 
		I will be doing. This is my portfolio page.</p>
    
    <h2>Brief about me</h2>
    <p>My name is Shubham and I love Data and the various use cases that can be attributed with just "data". 
	As Gavin Belson says, there will be Datageddon soon, (silicon valley reference) I am motivatd to learn how data can be stored, supplied and utilised in the best way possible!</p>
    
    <h3>Who I am right now:</h3>
    <p>I am 23, based out of Pune IN. I work at Barclays. I am also a student of BS in Data science and applications at IIT Madras. 
		I have close to 5 years of work experience in Operations as I started working right after my college. .</p>
    
    <h3>Why am I doing this:</h3>
    <p>Fairly and simply because I want to understand the use case of the data I am producing. 
		My job revolves around producing data, I want to join the data's journey from being produced to	being stored to being called useful. 
		As geeky it sounds, data excites me and I know with the coming dawn of AI and it's amazing new course, a good data set can make or break the model. (DE's get paid a lot too!!)</p>
    
    <h3>How?</h3>

    <p> By working on a lot of projects! I will share URL's for all the topics I will pick up </p>
        
    <p>This is my blogpost/ portfolio of the projects, I will write about what I faced issues with, how I managed to do x and what sources I took. 
		This is my personal diary but for projects I wish to show everyone :) 
	I understand that the page that I have just made (or created a repo) will look very un-organized but please bear with me, this is work in progress. </p>
