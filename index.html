    <h1>Welcome datalovers ❤️ ❤️</h1>
    <h2>I will just write the inauguration code here, print "hello world"</h2>
   <hr> 
    <p>Thank you for visiting! 
	This is my page where I am going to talk about my data engineering journey I am excited to share about my learning and the type of projects 
		I will be doing. This is my portfolio page.</p>
    
    <h2>Brief about me</h2>
    <p>My name is Shubham and I love Data and the various use cases that can be attributed with just "data". 
	As Gavin Belson says, there will be Datageddon soon, (silicon valley reference) I am motivatd to learn how data can be stored, supplied and utilised in the best way possible!</p>
    
    <h3>Who I am right now:</h3>
    <p>I am 23, based out of Pune IN. I work at Barclays. I am also a student of BS in Data science and applications at IIT Madras. 
		I have close to 5 years of work experience in Operations as I started working right after my college. .</p>
    
    <h3>Why am I doing this:</h3>
    <p>Fairly and simply because I want to understand the use case of the data I am producing. 
		My job revolves around producing data, I want to join the data's journey from being produced to	being stored to being called useful. 
		As geeky it sounds, data excites me and I know with the coming dawn of AI and it's amazing new course, a good data set can make or break the model. (DE's get paid a lot too!!)</p>
    
    <h3>How?</h3>

    <p> By working on a lot of projects! I will share URL's for all the topics I will pick up </p>
        
    <p>This is my blogpost/ portfolio of the projects, I will write about what I faced issues with, how I managed to do x and what sources I took. 
		This is my personal diary but for projects I wish to show everyone :) 
	I understand that the page that I have just made (or created a repo) will look very un-organized but please bear with me, this is work in progress. </p>

        <p>assist is a platform designed to help contact centers automate their workflow. This project aims to streamline operations and improve efficiency in customer service environments.</p>
        <p><strong>The site may not respond, the web-app is under construction</strong></p>
	<h4><a href="https://github.com/shuepathak/weather-data-collector"> Weather Data Collector</a></h4>
	    <p>The Weather Data Collector is a serverless application built on AWS that automatically fetches, processes, and stores weather data. The application utilizes AWS Lambda for computation, retrieves data from a public weather API, stores raw data in Amazon S3, and saves processed data in an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL database.</p>
