    <h1>Welcome datalovers ❤️ ❤️</h1>
    <h2>I will just write the inauguration code print "hello world"</h2>
    
    <p>This is my page where I am going to talk about my data engineering journey I am about to embark now.</p>
    
    <h2>Brief about me</h2>
    <p>My name is Shubham, I am 23, based out of Pune IN. I work at Barclays. I am also a student of BS in Data science and applications at IIT Madras. I love Data and quite frankly, this is my step one of showcasing my projects!</p>
    
    <h3>Who I am right now:</h3>
    <p>I have close to 5 years of work experience in Operations and I have mostly been at the end of using and more-so-ever, producing the data.</p>
    
    <h3>Why am I doing this:</h3>
    <p>Fairly and simply because I want to understand the use case of the data I am producing. (DE's get paid a lot too!!)</p>
    
    <h3>How?:</h3>
    <p>Oh to Fuck around and find out!</p>
    
    <p>I understand that the page that I have just made (or created a repo) will look very un-organized but please bear with me, this is work in progress.</p>
    
    <p>This is my blogpost/ portfolio of the projects, I will write about what I faced issues with, how I managed to do x and what sources I took.</p>
